UI:
- left sidebar should be fixed size (?) and content area should be resizable and shouldn't jump
- bottom preview should be resizable and hidable and movable to top
- fullscreen editing
- codemirror themes

JS:
- dropbox tree with icons
- marked: add code highlighting (see example on their github page) 
- codemirror hangs on gfm and on smart enter

After alfa:
- Integrate with ftp, livejournal and habrahanr for external publishing (in directory settings). Make a post on habr about it and work with feedback
