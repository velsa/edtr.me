UI:
- general settings dialog:  preview follows cursor (?)
- preview theme should be taken from metadata
- color icons in toolbar (from famfam silk set)
- folder settings: edit as text file (python style, like in pelican ?)
- special icons for each type: 'editing', 'published'. ask outsource designer to make those
- add sort by name, ext (default), date, sort order (ascending/descending)
- recent files submenu in File menu
- Allow viewing/choosing dropbox revisions of the edited file
- Add Shortcut/button to remove all trailng whitespace
- tree and editor keyboard shortcuts. decide where to use alt and ctrl (avoid clashing with mac and windows browser shortcuts) and make tree actions accessible from within editor
- add search/replace with autocomplete and regexp, a search dialog should popup in top right corner of the editor (or bottom, like i sublime ?)
- enable Ctrl - cursor movement (currently only Option works)
- Save button should show the Draft/Published status in all states:
    Save Draft
    SAVED (draft/published)
    SAVING DRAFT...

Marked:
- Add highlighter mechanism (see how it is done in demo on github repo)
- Add support for dt/dd (definition lists):
    http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/syntax.html#definition-lists
- Add support for custom attributes to markdown block and inline elements as in here: [Attribute Lists](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/attr_list.html)

JS:
- publish functionality:
    - *from editor* with Publish button. If file is already published and unmodified, Publish button is greyed out.

BUGS:
- ztree: it would be really nice to be able to drag node visually (as icon or as a text line) and to visually see which node it will become a child of (e.g. highlight the whole parent node structure during drag)
- ztree: if parent node is checked, but not loaded with ajax, its check_Child_State is -1, but when it is loaded, the check_Child_State becomes 1, although none of it's children are checked. So the check_Child_State should actually become 0
- ztree: refresh dir node without closing it first
- save doesn't check for exceptions (network errors, etc). Show "Saving..." text above rotating circle
- _xsrf: make a test ajax request on page load to force tornado to set the cookie

After alfa:
- Ad comments from facebook and disqus
- Integrate with ftp, livejournal and habrahanr for external publishing (in directory settings). Make a post on habr about it and work with feedback

Ideas:
- Add [reStructuredText mode](http://javascript.ru/forum/job/33595-js-professional-v-startap.html) in Codemirror and integration with [readthedocs.org](http://readthedocs.org)
