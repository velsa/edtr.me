UI:
- codemirror themes
- replace home icon in tree with dropbox icon
- general settings dialog:  codemirror theme, preview follows cursor
- folder settings: bind to existing domain name,
- tabs in editor
- dropbox tree with icons according to filetype and also special icons for each type: 'editing', 'published'
- add sort by name, ext (default), date, sort order (ascending/descending)
- show file info (get from server)
- recent files submenu in File menu
- tree and editor keyboard shortcuts. decide where to use alt and ctrl (avoid clashing with mac and windows browser shortcuts) and make tree actions accessible from within editor
- add search field on toolbar with autocomplete
- enable Ctrl - cursor movement (currently only Option works)
- Override Meta-S ?

Marked:
- Add highlighter mechanism (see how it is done in demo on github repo)

JS:
- marked: add code highlighting (see example on their github page)
- publish functionality:
    - *from editor* with Publish button. If file is already published and unmodified, Publish button is greyed out.
    - *from tree*: Web->Publish. If on directory, a confirmation dialog pops up, asking wether to publish all subdirs and files in this dir.

BUGS:
- ztree: it would be really nice to be able to drag node visually (as icon or as a text line) and to visually see which node it will become a child of (e.g. highlight the whole parent node structure during drag)
- ztree: if parent node is checked, but not loaded with ajax, its check_Child_State is -1, but when it is loaded, the check_Child_State becomes 1, although none of it's children are checked. So the check_Child_State should actually become 0
- ztree: refresh dir node without closing it first
- save doesn't check for exceptions (network errors, etc). Show "Saving..." text above rotating circle
- _xsrf: make a test ajax request on page load to force tornado to set the cookie

After alfa:
- Ad comments from facebook and disqus
- Integrate with ftp, livejournal and habrahanr for external publishing (in directory settings). Make a post on habr about it and work with feedback

Ideas:
- Add [reStructuredText mode](http://javascript.ru/forum/job/33595-js-professional-v-startap.html) in Codemirror and integration with [readthedocs.org](http://readthedocs.org)
