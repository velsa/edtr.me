UI:
- In general settings dialog:  preview follows cursor (?)
- folder settings: edit as text file (python style, like in pelican ?)
- special icons for each type: 'editing', 'published'. ask outsource designer to make those
- add sort by name, ext (default), date, sort order (ascending/descending)
- recent files submenu in File menu
- Allow viewing/choosing dropbox revisions of the edited file
- Add Shortcut/button to remove all trailng whitespace
- tree and editor keyboard shortcuts. decide where to use alt and ctrl (avoid clashing with mac and windows browser shortcuts) and make tree actions accessible from within editor
- add search/replace with autocomplete and regexp, a search dialog should popup in top right corner of the editor (or bottom, like i sublime ?)
- enable Ctrl - cursor movement (currently only Option works)
- metadata editing dialog - add option to insert current preview theme and preview code theme and Style and CodeStyle

Marked:
- Add highlighter mechanism (see how it is done in demo on github repo)
- Add support for dt/dd (definition lists):
    http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/syntax.html#definition-lists
- Add support for custom attributes to markdown block and inline elements as in here: [Attribute Lists](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/attr_list.html). Configure them in text file and specify it in metadata (?). This way a user can have 3 files: template, attrlist and css, which define site structure.

JS:
- publish functionality:
    If file is already published and unmodified, Publish button is greyed out.

BUGS:
- ztree: if parent node is checked, but not loaded with ajax, its check_Child_State is -1, but when it is loaded, the check_Child_State becomes 1, although none of it's children are checked. So the check_Child_State should actually become 0
- ztree: refresh dir node without closing it first
- save doesn't check for exceptions (network errors, etc). Show "Saving..." text above rotating circle
- _xsrf: make a test ajax request on page load to force tornado to set the cookie

After alfa:
- Ad comments from facebook and disqus
- Integrate with ftp, livejournal and habrahanr for external publishing (in directory settings). Make a post on habr about it and work with feedback

Ideas:
- Add [reStructuredText mode](http://javascript.ru/forum/job/33595-js-professional-v-startap.html) in Codemirror and integration with [readthedocs.org](http://readthedocs.org)
