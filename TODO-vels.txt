UI:
- codemirror themes
- replace home icon in tree with dropbox icon

Marked:
- Add highlighter mechanism (see how it is done in demo on github repo)

JS:
- dropbox tree with icons: use zTree
- marked: add code highlighting (see example on their github page) 
+ codemirror hangs on gfm and on smart enter @done (2013-01-21 18:12)

BUGS:
- in chrome, when selection is active in codemirror and mouse moves to tree area, selection disappears. Actually, and edit operation is being performed on codemirror. Why ?
- ztree: it would be really nice to be able to drag node visually (as icon or as a text line) and to visually see which node it will become a child of (e.g. highlight the whole parent node structure during drag)
- ztree: if parent node is checked, but not loaded with ajax, its check_Child_State is -1, but when it is loaded, the check_Child_State becomes 1, although none of it's children are checked. So the check_Child_State should actually become 0
- _xsrf: make a test ajax request on page load to force tornado to set the cookie

After alfa:
- Ad comments from facebook and disqus
- Integrate with ftp, livejournal and habrahanr for external publishing (in directory settings). Make a post on habr about it and work with feedback
