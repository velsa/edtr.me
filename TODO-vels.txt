UI:
- left sidebar should be fixed size (?) and content area should be resizable and shouldn't jump
- bottom preview should be resizable and hidable and movable to top
- fullscreen editing
- themes

JS:
- dropbox tree with icons
- marked: add code highlighting (see example on their github page)
- auto-scroll preview to the current cursor position in editor. For that, create filter in marked, which adds line number from markdown to html as anchor with name == line number. Then scroll to this anchor like here: http://jsfiddle.net/BjpWB/4/
